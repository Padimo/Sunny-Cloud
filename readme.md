# Sunny Cloud
Sunny Cloud is an ESP32-based LED art decoration in the form of a cloud. It connects to the user's WiFi network to pull time and weather to determine the patterns the LEDs will follow. It will also run a web server where connecting to a url (likely esp.local) will allow the user to control the settings more precisely.

This specific Blueprint submission aims to make five clouds which will be linked to each other using ESPNow.

Moving forward, I would love to implement HomeKit or Matter support for this project, however it is not in the scope of this project currently.

Note that the bulk of this project is programming the ESP, not building the hardware.
